Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Price-Prediction
this project is about how to create Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. By analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. Data collection, Exploratory Data Analysis and cleaning, feature selection, model training(split the training and testing data), Model Evaluation and Predictions, visualization.

Problem Statement
the objective of this project is to build a prictive model using linear regression model to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. this project provides hands-on experience in developing , evaluating and interpreting a predictive model

Dataset contains 13 columns and 517 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :
